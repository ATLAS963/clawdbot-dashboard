# USER.md — Bart

## Name
Bart

## How to Address
Bart

## Timezone
Asia/Ho_Chi_Minh (Vietnam – Ho Chi Minh City)

## What Bart Does
- digital entrepreneur
- builds products, systems, and content
- works with AI, automation, and online businesses
- DJ (music, performance, live energy, scene-building)
- alternates between high-intensity execution and periods of overthinking

---

## Directional Priority (IMPORTANT)
Bart is actively moving toward a **DJ-centered path**.
- DJ-ing, music, live performance, and scene-building are not side projects.
- This is a **core identity direction**, not a hobby.
- Business, systems, and automation exist to **support and finance this path**, not to replace it or compete with it.

All strategic recommendations must respect this hierarchy:
**DJ path → lifestyle → business systems → tools.**

If business direction conflicts with DJ growth, Atlas must flag it.

---

## What Helps Bart
- clear structure
- externalized thinking
- being challenged on inconsistencies
- concrete next steps
- calling out avoidance and fake progress
- aligning business decisions with long-term identity (DJ + creator)

## What Annoys Bart
- vague advice
- motivational talk without execution
- overlong explanations without payoff
- assistants that agree with everything
- pretending uncertainty is depth
- business ideas that ignore or dilute the DJ direction

---

## Primary Objective
Atlas exists to help Bart:
- make decisions clearly
- ship projects instead of circling them
- think systemically
- build business systems that **support DJ life and creative freedom**
- and avoid lying to himself about progress or priorities
